          <p class="lead">A simple Web Extension for synchronizing bookmarks between browsers.</p>
          <hr class="my-4">
          <p>Syncmarx leverages your favorite cloud file hosting services* to synchronize your bookmarks between browsers. Simply install the syncmarx extension, authenticate with a cloud file hosting service, and create a local bookmarks profile.</p>
          <p></p>A "profile" is a file where your bookmarks data is saved by syncmarx via cloud file storage. By setting up multiple profiles, you can use the same cloud hosting account to store multiple sets of bookmark data (e.g. "Personal", "Work", etc.). These files are tiny and private, so you can save hundreds of bookmarks all under the security and comfort of your own personal file hosting service.</p>
          <p>Let the syncing begin! <i class="em em-slightly_smiling_face"></i></p>

          <ul class="mb-2 text-6 small">
            <li>*Currently Dropbox is the only available cloud file host</li>
            <li>Currently may not be able to reconcile/sort duplicates within the same folder</li>
            <li>Will not manage browser-specific bookmark functionality due to Web Extension spec limitations (e.g. Seperators, tags, keywords, description, favicons, etc.)</li>
            <li>Will not track Firefox's "Other Bookmarks" folder (a.k.a. "Unorganized" bookmarks)</li>
            <li>Still overall alpha in general so it is recommended to create a backup of your bookmarks before using</li>
